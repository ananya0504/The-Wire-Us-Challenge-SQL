2. CASECADE
A foreign key with cascade delete means that if a record in the parent table 
is deleted, then the corresponding records in the child table will automatically 
be deleted. This is called a cascade delete in SQL Server.
   NO ACTION
It means that nothing will happen when you delete from your Subject table
to the Topic table. ... NO ACTION - The SQL Server Database Engine raises an 
error and the delete action on the row in the parent table is rolled back.
   SET NULL
It is used in conjunction with ON DELETE or ON UPDATE. It means that the 
child data is set to NULL when the parent data is deleted or updated.

table.
