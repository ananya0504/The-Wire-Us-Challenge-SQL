1.TYPES OF DATABASE
HIERARCHIAL DBMS
A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data are organized 
into a tree-like structure. The data are stored as records which are connected 
to one another through links. A record is a collection of fields, with each field
containing only one value.

RELATIONAL DBMS
A relational database management system (RDBMS or just RDB) is a common 
type of database whose data is stored in tables. You'll find that most databases
used in businesses these days are relational databases, as opposed to a flat
file or hierarchical database.

NETWORK DBMS
Network database management systems (Network DBMSs) are based on a network data 
model that allows each record to have multiple parents and multiple child records.
A network database allows flexible relationship model between entities.
The result is a faster data access, search, and navigation.

THERE IS NO LOOP DATABSE.

2. All the above are types of inner joins(THETA, NATURAL, EQUIJOIN).

3. Although TRUNCATE TABLE is similar to DELETE , it is classified as a DDL 
statement rather than a DML statement. Truncate operations drop and re-create 
the table, which is much faster than deleting rows one by one, particularly 
for large tables. TRUNCATE cannot be executed with a WHERE clause means 
that all records will be removed from the TRUNCATE / statement.
