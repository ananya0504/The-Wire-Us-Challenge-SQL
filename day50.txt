Q1. In terms of performance, when dealing with small partition sizes—as
many as a few hundred rows per partition—you're better off with a 
set-based solution. However, when dealing with large partitions—more
than 500 rows—you're better off with a cursor-based solution.

Set based queries are (usually) faster because:
They have more information for the query optimizer to optimize
They can batch reads from disk
There's less logging involved for rollbacks, transaction logs, etc.
Less locks are taken, which decreases overhead
Set based logic is the focus of RDBMSs, so they've been heavily
optimized for it (often, at the expense of procedural performance)


Q2. T-SQL means Transact-SQL, a propriety Language by Microsoft. 
Microsoft and Sybase released version 1.0 in 1989.


Q3. Cursor lock types - Cursors allow row-by-row processing of the resultsets.
They are a database object which is used to retrieve data from a resultset one row at a time.

Following are the three lock types of cursor:
1. READ ONLY
2. SCROLL LOCK
3. OPTIMISTIC

Each time you fetch a row from the cursor, it results in a network roundtrip.
Cursors are also costly because they require more resources and temporary storage.

1. READ ONLY:It prevents any updates to the table.

2. SCROLL LOCK:It allows you to make changes to the table.

3. OPTIMISTIC: It checks if any changes in the table record since the rows are fetched before updating.
If there is no change, then the cursor can update.
